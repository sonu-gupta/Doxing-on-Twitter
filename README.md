## Prevention and Anonymization of Dox Content on Twitter

Summary:
<ol>
    <li> Trained a Machine Learning model for automatic detection of <i>doxed</i> data on Twitter. </li> 
    <li> Developed a nudge-based technology to alert the doxer that the tweet contains private information. </li> 
    <li> Created a prototype that add noise to tweets with <i>doxed </i> information in real-time by implementation of hashing algorithm. </li>
</ol>



This work was done as part of the course IST-597 Fundamentals of Privacy at Penn State.

This repository contains the python code, trained model and the demo of the tool I developed. 

Demo 1 - Classification of a Tweet to identify doxing  <br>
Demo 2 - Nudging the user to not post the Tweet that contains sensitive content  <br>
Demo 3 - Anonymizing the Tweet content if the user ignores the nudge.  <br>

Note: Due to privacy concerns, I couldn't share the dataset. The dataset contains user's SSN and IP address information.

PS. More description on methodology coming soon.

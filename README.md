## Prevention and Anonymization of Dox Content on Twitter

This repository contains the python code, trained model and the demo of the tool I developed. 

Demo 1 - Classification of a Tweet to identify doxing  <br>
Demo 2 - Nudging the user to not post the Tweet that contains sensitive content  <br>
Demo 3 - Anonymizing the Tweet content if the user ignores the nudge.  <br>

Note: Due to privacy concerns, I couldn't share the dataset. The dataset contains user's SSN and IP address information.
